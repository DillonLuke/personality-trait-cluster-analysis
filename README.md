# Personality Trait Cluster Analysis

The most prominent model of personality in psychology is the Big Five Model which is comprised of five fundamental personality dimensions on which people differ:

1. **Extraversion**: characterized by traits like sociability and assertiveness
2. **Agreeableness**: characterized by traits like compassion and respectfulness
3. **Conscientiousness**: characterized by traits like productiveness and responsibility
4. **Neuroticism**: characterized by traits like anxiety and emotional volatility
5. **Openness to Experience**: characterized by traits like intellectual curiosity and creativity

Using data from three distinct samples (*N*=800), the purpose of this project is to cluster individuals across these five personality dimensions as a way of identifying latent personality profiles. All data preprocessing can be seen in **”Data Cleaning and Preprocessing.ipynb”** and cluster analyses can be seen in **”Personality Trait Cluster Analysis.ipynb.”**
